      The <a href="http://coop.cs.umanitoba.ca/">Computer Science Co-op Program</a>
      at the University of Manitoba provides students with a fantastic opportunity to transform academic
      knowledge into real-world experience. The program has garnered much success over the last few years and has become one of the
      university's largest co-op programs securing an average of 180 placements per year. The program focuses on matching students with
      employers for three four-month work terms. The list of companies range from local Winnipeg-based start-ups to international corporations.
