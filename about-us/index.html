            UMWICS exists to support the female Computer Science students at the University of Manitoba and we aim
            to promote awareness of the importance of women within the Computer Science community.

            <br>
            <br>
            We have done a project in web-development using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as a project in
            application development using Android Studio, and are looking into making many
            more projects in different languages in the future.

            <br>
            <br>
            We have organized a Hack Day this past November, and look forward to organizing another Hack Day this year
            where we will spend the day enhancing our coding skills.

            <br>
            <br>
            We also have put a big focus on creating outreach programs to encourage students
            to enter into the Computer Science field, and have already done so at Glenlawn Collegiate and will be
            continuing to do so at Carman Collegiate and Balmoral High School this semester.

            <br>
            <br>
            We are incredibly excited for the upcoming year to continue with the activities of our group!
